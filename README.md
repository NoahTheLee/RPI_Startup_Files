# RPI_Startup_Files
The purpose of this repository is to be a small set of files and resources that I'll use to startup my Raspberry Pis
    Executables, background images, software, and the like will be stored here for my convenience
    Along with, hopefully, some instructions for anyone else who wishes to clone my Pi setups
